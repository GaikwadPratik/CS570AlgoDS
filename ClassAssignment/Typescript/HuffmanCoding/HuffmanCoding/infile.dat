Today I investigated my blogging habits and found pretty sad scene - In average I'm blogging 200 words (and in some month even less) in a day. And I'm willing to change that.
Since October 2013, I ran a Can you blog 365 days in row contest. I have been blogging for about 8 month already, with a 2 day failure. At start in October I wrote 64 articles in average with 225 words per article.

Total word count by month
In above graph you can see how many words in total I have written in past 9 months. Since I started to blog back in October, it's obviously seen that I was really excited to blog, and have made a record word count - 14404 words in October.
Then my word count ratio goes down and reaches it's minimum in month of  March - 3604 words in March.

In above graph you can see my average word count per article. The Maximum is in this month (240) and the minimum word count is in last month (102). Last month I was on 2 week travels and mostly blogged from my phone, that's how I can explain such a low word count.
Starting now I'm willing to write a minimum of 400 words in a day.
Why 400, why not 2000 words in a day?
Yup, I agree 2000 words in a day might be much better, I even wrote an article on how to write 2000 and more words in a day. But speaking of me - I'm not quite ready to keep both - bloging every day and writing 2000 words in a day (per article).  So I decided to align my blogging habits with search engine optimization. I mean -  you can see from the graphs above I'm barely getting above 240 words per article, and in some months it's even less. That's way - 400 words per article is still pretty high level for me, but I believe I can achieve this. Later on I can increase my word count per article. Just to remind - I'm blogging every day, so it's vital to have articles every day. Of-course I could write one article per week with 2000 words, but in this case it's not gone work.
How SEO is involved here?
According to my inner feeling and some authoritative resources out there, I have found that Google uses word count as one of the criteria for it's SERP (Search engine ranking position).
And if I have articles just 200 words long there is huge possibility that my articles wont rank. Well, I'm not saying they wont rank at all. They will. And I'm a live example on that. My blog is receiving traffic from organic search. For a last 3 months it has been around 1000 visitors from Google search. It's not much and it's not nothing. It's pretty modest result, I agree.
So considering different tactics to drive more traffic for my blog, I discovered that one of bottleneck is too many short articles.
Too many short articles mean I'm loosing Long Tail possibilities.
When a searcher searches there are many combinations of keywords he/she will use on their search query on Google. By having longer articles there is greater chance to be found, because in longer articles are more words. More words, more keywords. More keywords, better possibility to rank.
What else 400 words in a day can give?
It could became a good habit for you - you will learn how to write longer posts, to argument and summarize.
