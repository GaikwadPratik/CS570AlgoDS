# CeasarCiphar

You will be deciphering a given message. It is encrypted with a Caesar Cipher that increases by 2 after every 3 characters 
<b>(including symbol characters, which are not encoded)</b>, starting at key = 5. You should save this message to a file using a text editor. 
Then, your program will prompt the user for the name of the file, decrypt the message stored in the file, and then write the decrypted message to a new file called solution.txt.
