# MaxHeapImplementation

Using only an array/list/vector (depending on your language of choice), construct a max-heap data structure. 
Then, read in 10 numbers from the screen, 1 line at a time. Store each one in your max-heap, one at a time. 
Then, output the numbers in descending order, <b>one line at at time</b>, by <b><u>repeatedly</u></b> retrieving and deleting the largest item from the heap.
You must use a max-heap to solve this problem, and you must implement the heap yourself using an array/list/vector. No other data structure will be permitted.
